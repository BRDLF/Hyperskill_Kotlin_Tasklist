# Hyperskill_Kotlin_Tasklist

This was the fourth project I completed as part of Jetbrain Academy's "Kotlin Basics" course

It is rated as a challenging difficulty project. It asks the student to program a task list program capable of creating, editing, displaying, saving and loading a list of tasks input by the user.
By the time I had done this course, I'd already learned much of what this project was trying to teach, with the exception of using JSON with kotlin, File access, and lambda expressions.

I feel like the project sortof glosses over builder methods and using moshi and instead just tells you barely enough to do what the project intends you to do.
Oh. This is also the first project I completed where I really made use of java's String formatting. When they had me elaborate on the "print" method my original designs went overboard for what they needed to be.

As usual, I have also included the tests that Hyperskill uses to determine if a project is complete.
